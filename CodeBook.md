This code book describes the TidyData file submitted for the Course Project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course, offered February 2015.

The TidyData file contains selected, averaged data calculated from the data compiled by the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones project. A full description of the underlying data is at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones (HARUS), the data itself is at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip .

In brief, the source (HARUS) data consists of a set of observations from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung mobile phone; the observations were taken for 30 subjects doing 6 activities each. with 561 separate observations per record. 

The TidyData set was created from the HARUS data by the following transformations:
First, the test and training data was combined for the x files (x_test.txt and x_train.txt), then for the y files (y_test.txt and y_train.txt), and then the subject identifiers for the various subject and training data and the activity identifiers for the various activities. The subject identifiers, activity identifiers, and ONLY the columns of X and Y test and training data that contained averages or standard deviations were then bound into a single data frame; then for each subject and activity, the arithmetic mean of the observation columns of that data frame were calculated and reported. The 'Subject' column contains the identifier for the human subject; the 'Activity' column contains a text identifier  for the type of activity that the mean applies to, and the other column names are directly taken from the underlying data, and contain the means of the relevant columns in the source data. The complete list of columns in TidyData are:
